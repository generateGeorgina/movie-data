# movie-data
First I experimented with the movieData object in the console by logging different properties and values. Then I practised rendering data on to the HTML page. Then I created a function so I could list all the movie titles in movieData by turning the keys into an array and adding a space by creating a function that iterated through the array. I then created a drop down list. For the drop down list I tried to display different movie details using the click event listener. Originally, my function did display movie details, but it only displayed [object Object]. A mentor helped me to rearrange my code, and then it was working to log the cast of each movie to the console. Then, I consulted Stack Overflow to learn how to render different casts of each movie as the at the time, only the last film The Grand Budapest Hotel had the cast displayed for all movies, even though this was not the case in the console. Using the .value method, I was able to move the function call outside of the for..in loop which allowed me to only call the function once per each click event. After I got my delete button working by creating a delete function using what I had learned from movie details and .values.
